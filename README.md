# Explainable AI for Object Detection in Autonomous Driving
Team: Ritika Shrivastava, Saransh Singh, Rishikesh Kakde
Developed an Explainable AI system for object detection in autonomous driving, enhancing model transparency and trust.
- Implemented and compared four state-of-the-art object detection models: Faster R-CNN (my contribution), YOLOv8, RetinaNet, and SSD (my contribution).
- Utilized the Udacity Self-Driving Car Dataset with 15,000 images and 12 object classes.
- Applied Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps for visual explanations of model decisions (my contribution).
- Achieved best performance with Faster R-CNN (mAP: 0.78, IoU: 0.84) and YOLOv8 (mAP: 0.688, IoU: 0.69).
- Demonstrated the balance between accuracy and real-time performance for autonomous driving applications.
- Enhanced model interpretability, crucial for safety and regulatory compliance in self-driving technologies.
This project bridged the gap between high-performance object detection and explainable AI, contributing to more transparent and trustworthy autonomous driving systems.
